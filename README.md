# Stringier-console-validation

A simple demo project to show off using Stringier to validate console input and do basic parsing.

This is a contrived CRUD application providing a directory of employees. It does not represent good database practices in any way, and in fact doesn't actually use a proper database (it's easier to distribute this way). It should only be viewed as demonstrating text validation through Stringier as opposed to Regex, and not anything beyond that.

Because an actual database isn't used, files are written which store the objects. As a result, this demo also shows off some basics of using Stringier to parse. Filesystem-as-a-Database is an actual thing, but this demo doesn't show how to properly do that either. Again, it is only a demonstration of Stringier for validation.
